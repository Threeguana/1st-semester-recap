### 🧮 Operator: Exploring Java Operators 🚀  
A Java program demonstrating various operators and their behavior.

#### ✨ Features:  
- 🔢 **Increment Operators**: Showcases the difference between `x++` (post-increment) and `++x` (pre-increment).  
- 🔗 **Logical Operators**: Combines `||`, `&&`, and comparison operators for conditional evaluations.  
- 🔧 **Bitwise Operator**: Demonstrates the XOR operator (`^`) in action.  
- ➗ **Modulus Assignment**: Applies `%=` for remainder operations.  
- 🖨️ **Console Output**: Prints all operations with explanations for clarity.
